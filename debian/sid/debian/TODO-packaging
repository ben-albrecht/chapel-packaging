* Re-build the parser/lexer with flex/bison
* Re-build the RST documentation (with chpldoc)
  - challenges:
     1) relevant Makefiles not in release
* Re-build the HTML documentation from the RST (with sphinx)
  - challenges:
     1) Makefile for RST -> HTML not in release
     2) Build process can't download anything (which we do now for
        a virtualenv)

  * install HTML documentation to /usr/share/doc/chapel/html
    ... it seems we can remove the jquery and possibly other javascript?
        ... I think the Search functionality is built with JavaScript...

    ... or see julia's package for HTML docs that included jquery/sphinx

* where to install highlighters?
    .... generally not part of the source package
         ... separate repositories

Upstream build / install TODOs
* make distclean to remove generated files
* make installdocs, installexamples
* make install removes .timestamp
* CHPL_HWLOC=system
