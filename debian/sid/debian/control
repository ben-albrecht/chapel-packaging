Description: Minimal compiler for the Chapel programming language
 Minimal compiler without third-party dependencies for Chapel, an emerging
 programming language designed for productive parallel computing at scale.

 Chapel's design and implementation have been undertaken with portability in
 mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity
 clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which
 it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in
 collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry.
