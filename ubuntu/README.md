# Building Chapel Package for Ubuntu

This directory contains the utility scripts and debian files for
building the Chapel package for Ubuntu

## Prerequisites:
The utility scripts should let you know if something isn't set, but you could
also read this and set them beforehand:

* Ideally for testing, you'll want to be running a VM with the OS and
    particular release you are building a package for.
* PATH=chapel-packaging/util:$PATH or source chapel-packaging/util/source-me.sh
* Set `$CHPL_RELEASE` variable to the path of a Chapel tarball/release dir
    * If you want to build a release from master, call `$CHPL_HOME/util/buildRelease/genRelease`

* TODO: Packages to preinstall
* TODO: Account setup for deployment 

## Scripts

All scripts have the same usage:

Usage:

    ./<script> <release>
    # or
    export UBUNTU_RELEASE=<release>
    ./<script>


### build.sh

Builds a .deb and .dpkg for the provided Ubuntu release (e.g. trusty) from the
unpacked release tarball of Chapel

### test.sh

Tests the package by installing it on the current machine, uninstalling it,
and generating lintian logs

### release.sh

Prepares the package for upstream deployment and review

### clean.sh

Removes any files or directories generated by any of the other scripts

### config.sh

Not executable.

Contains all the variables necessary for other scripts
